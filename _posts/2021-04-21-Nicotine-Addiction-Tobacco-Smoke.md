Nicotine is an alkaloid primarily responsible for tobacco addiction. Once it enters the body it binds to nChRs- otherwise known as Nitotinic Acetylcholine Receptors and releases domaine, glutamate and gamma aminobutyric acid which causes dependency in those who use nicotine and tobacco products. Nicotine addiction can be inherited genetically because nicotinic receptors can vary based on genetic factors. This may in some way explain why some are able to quit smoking fairly quickly while others have a more difficult time and may not succeed.

Using nicotine and tobacco products has been linked in an obvious way to many health issues; including several types of cancers, heart disease, lung disease and many other disorders. Over 80% of tobacco users who attempt to quit will relapse within the first month of stopping and only 3% of users make it past 6 months without relapsing. This is extremely powerful evidence to the power nicotine and tobacco have over those who are dependent on it. (Benowitz)

Nicotine when separated from tobacco and tobacco smoke is not nearly as dangerous compared to when consumed through tobacco products. However, many smokers when trying to quit and turning to nicotine patches, gum and vapes are not able to fully quit smoking cigarettes. This makes me question if there are any psychoactive or addictive properties found in tobacco that are not being discussed or have not been discovered.

Looking into this, it was extremely difficult to find any resources at all on the potentially addictive compounds found in tobacco other than nicotine so maybe they do not exist but I'd like to look into this in the future and maybe at some point complete some tobacco extractions to further clarify exactly what compounds are present in tobacco we may not know about.
